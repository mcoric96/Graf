# Shortest path solver
This project is made for my course Introduction to artificial intelligence using tool NetLogo.
I implemented a few searching algorithms on weighted connected graphs, heuristics vs informed search.
The goal is finding shortest path between 2 different nodes of graph. I made statistical comparison(you can see it in documentation) of those algorithms,parameters of comparison were completeness(for heuristics) , time(steps of each algorithm for 1 graph) and memory(total number of "agents" used for search per 1 graph).
